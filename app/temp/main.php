		<h3>What is Favr?</h3>
		Favr is a favor-exchange app. You begin with a set amount of points
		which are used to buy favors from other users. Favors are categorized
		by type and each user chooses which type of favor s/he is willing to
		execute. Each favor has: a time frame for which it will stay on the
		app, a start and end location (to know where the favor takes place), a
		price (composed of a certain number of points), and a description of
		the favor. The requester creates a favor, the do-er chooses a favor to
		complete. The requester must confirm the do-er in order for the do-er to
		start the favor. Once confirmed and completed, both the requester and the
		do-er must confirm that the favor has been completed for the transfer
		of points to take place. This app is not responsible for any loss of
		time or money that occurred while performing a favor.
